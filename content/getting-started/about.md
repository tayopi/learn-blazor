## Introduction

I am a passionate web developer. The technology stack I mostly use is ASP.NET Core (C#) on the server and Angular (TypeScript) on the client. Having to constantly switch between two programming languages and frameworks isn't very efficient. Because of this, I started using Node.js on the server some years ago. It allows me to use TypeScript consistently.

Blazor is tempting for me because it also allows me to focus on one programming language. However, this time I can use my favorite language C#. Awesome :-)

At the time of writing, Blazor is in a very early stage. Microsoft calls it an *experimental* project. Its first public preview has been [announced](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/03/22/get-started-building-net-web-apps-in-the-browser-with-blazor/) on March 22nd, 2018.

Today, nobody knows for sure what the future of Blazor is. It might change fundamentally, it might even never see the light of day. **Don't build production systems with it today!** It's time to experiment, contribute, and give feedback.

Microsoft [has announced](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2018/S207) that they plan to release the [Server-side Hosting Model](https://blazor.net/docs/host-and-deploy/hosting-models.html#server-side-hosting-model) with [.NET Core 3](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/07/net-core-3-and-support-for-windows-desktop-applications/).

## Target Audience

This website is for developers who want to experiment with Blazor at this early stage of the project. It assumes that you have background knowledge in client- and server-side web development with JavaScript and C#. This website is not well suited for people trying to start web development.

## Samples

If you want to execute and experiment with the code shown on this page, download the complete samples [from GitHub](https://github.com/software-architects/learn-blazor/tree/master/samples).
